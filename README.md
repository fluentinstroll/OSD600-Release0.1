<u>Updates</u>
- Update 1: I noticed I was making things harder then they need to be. Instead of using the readLine api I used fs.readFileSync. Now I need to see how RegEx works in Javascript. [Sept 15 2020 12:32 PM]
- Update 2: Played around with RegEx in Javascript, have a understanding on how it works, for now this reads the fine line by line, matches abc and stores every match in a array. Next I need to see how to make a RegEx expression to match URLs using the http:// and https:// schemes. That way I can then go through the array and test each URL to see if its broken. I put some Stack Overflow references I will look at later on [Sept 15 2020 8:08 PM]
- Update 3: Got the regular expression to find links in a file and store them in an array. The next step is to go through this array and test every link to see if it works or not. I also added a folder with a PDF of a article I found that shows useful Regular Expressions I may use one day. I like to keep useful atricles and code snippits since it makes the work riaser in the future. [Sept 16 2020 12:23 PM]
